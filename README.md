# Daily tasks

I keep here scripts that run routine maintenance tasks
daily on my Arch Linux workstation. They are particular
to my set up and I do not know if they are useful for
others.

The script(s) here assume that `ssh` access has been
setup using `.ssh/config` with no passphrase necessary.
Use keys with no passphrase only with care.

It also assumes that for the commands executed in this
script `sudo` does not require a password. Note that
this can be done for specific commands only.
